== Introduction
//tag::introduction[]
Infinity Book is a desktop application that provides Tech recruiters end-to-end support, from searching for candidates,to adding job postings and saving their resumes and interviews. +

More importantly, IB is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a desktop Command Line Interface* (link:#cli[CLI]) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (link:#gui[GUI]). If you can type fast, IB can get your candidates management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps. +

[[CommandLine]]
== Command Line

Infinity Book uses a command line interface that follows the command format given below. Auto-complete and auto-correct are optimised to assist in CLI usage as detailed in this section.

=== Command Format

* Command starts with a `COMMAND WORD` to specify the command you want to perform.
* Words prefixed with a dash (optional) are `COMMAND OPTION` e.g. in `edit -add-tag t/TAG`, `-add-tag` is a command option.
* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `[t/TAG]...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.
//tag::autocomplete[]
=== Auto-complete and auto-correct

To enhance your experience with the Command Line Interface(CLI), Infinity Book comes with built in auto-correct and auto-complete. This section explains
how you can use these features to speed up your CLI experience.

==== Auto-complete
Auto completes command words being typed into Infinity Book. +

To auto-complete a command word:

. Type in atleast the first character of your command word.
. Press kbd:[TAB] until your desired command word appears in the command box.

[NOTE]
Entered text must match (case sensitive) the start of the desired command. +
If no matches are available, no change is made to the input text.

*Example:*

** `li` + kbd:[TAB] : Completes command word to `list`.

** `LI` + kbd:[TAB]  : Reports no completions found.

[TIP]
====
Use kbd:[TAB] repeatedly to loop through the list as many times as you need.
====


==== Auto-correct
Auto correct spell checks command words being typed into Infinity Book. +

To auto-correct a command word:

[NOTE]
Entered text must be within one edit-distance of the desired command, by removal, addition or swapping of adjacent characters +
If no corrections are available, no change is made to the input text.

. Type in a possibly incorrect version of the command word.
. Press kbd:[SPACE] and watch the command word auto-corrected immediately.

[TIP]
====
If a copy-pasted command may contain a spelling error in the command word, press kbd:[SPACE] to
correct the command word without affecting the arguments entered.
====

*Example:*

** `lsit` +  kbd:[SPACE] : Corrects command word to `list`.

** `lit` +   kbd:[SPACE] : Corrects command word to `list`.

** `liist` + kbd:[SPACE] : Corrects command word to `list`.

** `lllist` + kbd:[SPACE] : Does not make any correction.

[WARNING]
====
While copy pasting commands with spelling errors, the kbd:[SPACE] key will not be available for use to insert spaces in the command while editing.

Want to add a newly available job vacancy to IB and match candidates to this role? Add a job posting using the `postjob` command.

*Format:* `postjob j/JOB TITLE l/LOCATION t/[TAGS] s/SKILLS`

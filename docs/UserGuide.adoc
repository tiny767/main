== Introduction

Infinity Book (IB) is for those Tech recruiters who *prefer to use a desktop app for managing candidates*.  +

More importantly, IB is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (link:#cli[CLI]) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (link:#gui[GUI]). If you can type fast, IB can get your candidates management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps. +

=== Dashboard Reporting

==== Understanding The Workflow

As a recruiter, your work mainly involves monitoring the progress of open jobs. Imagining a working day, you have to
keep track of the number of new candidates, interviewees, and accepted offer, which is time-consuming given there is a
significant number of candidates. Furthermore, you may want to analyze the productivity of your recruiting team in the
last week, month, and quarter. Keeping track of historical data becomes necessary here. +

Infinity Book proposes a workflow that helps you efficiently achieve these requirements: +

1. Summarize each candidate by a few keywords using `Tagging` feature. Example: `new`, `interviewing`, `offering`,
`accepted`, ... +

2. Define a pie-chart report tailored to your specific goals. A report is defined by one `population` tag and at most
three `group` tags. Example:

image::graph.png[width="500"]
Figure 1: Data Visualization: Dashboard Reporting

You are recruiting interns, and you can use this report to keep track of the number of candidates in each stage. This
report is defined by  tag `SoftwareEngineerInterns` as `population` tag,  and `screening`, `interviewing`, `accepted`
as `group` tags. +

3.Save the current state of report persistently so that you can retrieve it in the future.

==== Managing tag of a person: refer to `edit` command

==== Adding a new report : `report -new` [coming in v1.4]

* *Description:* Need to keep track certain information? Add new report using `report -new` command. +
* *Format:*  `report -new POPULATION [GROUP 1] [GROUP 2] [GROUP 3]` +
This will create a new Report with name presented in the format: `POPULATION_[GROUP 1]_[GROUP 2]_[GROUP 3]` +
* *Examples:* `report -new SoftwareEngineerInterns screening interviewing accepted` +
This should create a new report named `SoftwareEngineerInterns_screening_interviewing_accepted`.

==== Removing a report : `report -remove` [coming in v1.4]
* *Description:* To remove a report, use `report -remove` command
* *Format:*  `report -remove REPORT_NAME`

==== Saving the current state of report `report -freeze` [coming in v1.4]
* *Description:* To save the current state of a report persistently, use `report -freeze` command.
* *Format:*  `report -freeze POPULATION [GROUP 1] [GROUP 2] [GROUP 3]`
* *Examples:* `report -freeze SoftwareEngineerInterns_screening_interviewing_accepted` +
This will add an entry to report `SoftwareEngineerInterns_screening_interviewing_accepted` including list of emails and
number of candidates in each group.

==== List all available reports [coming in v2.0]

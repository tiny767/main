== Introduction
Infinity Book is an Infinity Book application for Tech recruiters who *prefer to use a desktop app to keep track candidates' information, job postings, and interview*.  +

Infinity Book provides end-to-end support, from searching for candidates,to adding job postings and saving their resumes and interviews. +

More importantly, Infinity Book is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (link:#cli[CLI]) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (link:#gui[GUI]). If you can type fast, Infinity Book can get your candidates management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps. +

== Setting up

This section provides step-by-step instructions to set up Infinity Book for development on your computer. +


=== Prerequisites

To continue development, the following two prerequisites are recommended to be met:

. *JDK `1.8.0_60`* or later
+
[NOTE]
Having any Java 8 version is not enough. +
This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.
+

. *IntelliJ* IDE
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed. +
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.


=== Setting up the project in your computer

After meeting the <<Prerequisites, prerequisites>>, follow these steps to set up the project on your computer:

. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first)
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`
. Click `Open as Project`
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`). It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +
This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.

=== Verifying the setup

. Run the `seedu.address.MainApp` and try a few commands
. <<Testing,Run the tests>> to ensure they all pass.

=== Configurations to do before writing code

Configuring the coding style, documentation and continuous integration (CI) is recommended to maintain uniformity across contributions.

==== Configuring the coding style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.adoc[oss-generic coding standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. To rectify,

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS)
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`

Optionally, you can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance as you write code.

==== Updating documentation to match your fork

After forking the repo, links in the documentation will still point to the `se-edu/addressbook-level4` repo. If you plan to develop this as a separate product (i.e. instead of contributing to the `se-edu/addressbook-level4`) , you should replace the URL in the variable `repoURL` in `DeveloperGuide.adoc` and `UserGuide.adoc` with the URL of your fork.

==== Setting up CI

Set up Travis to perform Continuous Integration (CI) for your fork. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to set it up.

After setting up Travis, you can optionally set up coverage reporting for your team fork (see <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Coverage reporting could be useful for a team repository that hosts the final version but it is not that useful for your personal fork.

Optionally, you can set up AppVeyor as a second CI (see <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Having both Travis and AppVeyor ensures your App works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms (Travis is Unix-based and AppVeyor is Windows-based)

==== Getting started with coding

When you are ready to start coding,

1. Get some sense of the overall design by reading <<Design-Architecture>>.
2. Take a look at <<GetStartedProgramming>>.

<<top,Back to top>>

== Design
[[Design-Architecture]]

The following sections describe the architecture of the system, with details about each component.

=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::Architecture.png[width="600"]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.pptx` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder. To update a diagram, modify the diagram in the pptx file, select the objects of the diagram, and choose `Save as picture`.

`Main` has only one class called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components. Two of those classes play important roles at the architecture level.

* `EventsCenter` : This class (written using https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained[Google's Event Bus library]) is used by components to communicate with other components using events (i.e. a form of _Event Driven_ design)
* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

.Class Diagram of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

[discrete]
==== Events-Driven nature of the design

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 1)
image::SDforDeletePerson.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
Note how the `Model` simply raises a `AddressBookChangedEvent` when the Infinity Book data are changed, instead of asking the `Storage` to save the updates to the hard disk.

The diagram below shows how the `EventsCenter` reacts to that event, which eventually results in the updates being saved to the hard disk and the status bar of the UI being updated to reflect the 'Last Updated' time.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 2)
image::SDforDeletePersonEventHandling.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
Note how the event is propagated through the `EventsCenter` to the `Storage` and `UI` without `Model` having to be coupled to either of them. This is an example of how this Event Driven approach helps us reduce direct coupling between components.

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `BrowserPanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Binds itself to some data in the `Model` so that the UI can auto-update when data in the `Model` change.
* Responds to events raised from various parts of the App and updates the UI accordingly.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

.Structure of Commands in the Logic Component. This diagram shows finer details concerning `XYZCommand` and `Command` in <<fig-LogicClassDiagram>>
image::LogicCommandClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person) and/or raise events.
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command
image::DeletePersonSdForLogic.png[width="800"]

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Infinity Book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Infinity Book data in xml format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

link:#top[Back to top]

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::undoredo[]
=== Undo/Redo feature
==== Current Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by an `UndoRedoStack`, which resides inside `LogicManager`. It supports undoing and redoing of commands that modifies the state of the Infinity Book (e.g. `add`, `edit`). Such commands will inherit from `UndoableCommand`.

`UndoRedoStack` only deals with `UndoableCommands`. Commands that cannot be undone will inherit from `Command` instead. The following diagram shows the inheritance diagram for commands:

image::LogicCommandClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

As you can see from the diagram, `UndoableCommand` adds an extra layer between the abstract `Command` class and concrete commands that can be undone, such as the `DeleteCommand`. Note that extra tasks need to be done when executing a command in an _undoable_ way, such as saving the state of the Infinity Book before execution. `UndoableCommand` contains the high-level algorithm for those extra tasks while the child classes implements the details of how to execute the specific command. Note that this technique of putting the high-level algorithm in the parent class and lower-level steps of the algorithm in child classes is also known as the https://www.tutorialspoint.com/design_pattern/template_pattern.htm[template pattern].

Commands that are not undoable are implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public class ListCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... list logic ...
    }
}
----

With the extra layer, the commands that are undoable are implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public abstract class UndoableCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... undo logic ...

        executeUndoableCommand();
    }
}

public class DeleteCommand extends UndoableCommand {
    @Override
    public CommandResult executeUndoableCommand() {
        // ... delete logic ...
    }
}
----

Suppose that the user has just launched the application. The `UndoRedoStack` will be empty at the beginning.

The user executes a new `UndoableCommand`, `delete 5`, to delete the 5th candidate in the Infinity Book. The current state of the Infinity Book is saved before the `delete 5` command executes. The `delete 5` command will then be pushed onto the `undoStack` (the current state is saved together with the command).

.UndoRedo stack at the start.
image::UndoRedoStartingStackDiagram.png[width="800"]

As the user continues to use the program, more commands are added into the `undoStack`. For example, the user may execute `add n/David ...` to add a new person.

.Undo Redo stack showing add command.
image::UndoRedoNewCommand1StackDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not be pushed to the `UndoRedoStack` at all.

The user now decides that adding the candidate was a mistake, and decides to undo that action using `undo`.

We will pop the most recent command out of the `undoStack` and push it back to the `redoStack`. We will restore the Infinity Book to the state before the `add` command executed.

.UndoRedo stack demonstration
image::UndoRedoExecuteUndoStackDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If the `undoStack` is empty, then there are no other commands left to be undone, and an `Exception` will be thrown when popping the `undoStack`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

.Sequence diagram for the undo operation.
image::UndoRedoSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

The redo does the exact opposite (pops from `redoStack`, push to `undoStack`, and restores the Infinity Book to the state after the command is executed).

[NOTE]
If the `redoStack` is empty, then there are no other commands left to be redone, and an `Exception` will be thrown when popping the `redoStack`.

The user now decides to execute a new command, `clear`. As before, `clear` will be pushed into the `undoStack`. This time the `redoStack` is no longer empty. It will be purged as it no longer make sense to redo the `add n/David` command (this is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow).

.UndoRedo stack showing Redo operation.
image::UndoRedoNewCommand2StackDiagram.png[width="800"]

Commands that are not undoable are not added into the `undoStack`. For example, `list`, which inherits from `Command` rather than `UndoableCommand`, will not be added after execution:

.UndoRedo stack showing no changes due to Commands that are not undoable.
image::UndoRedoNewCommand3StackDiagram.png[width="800"]

The following activity diagram summarize what happens inside the `UndoRedoStack` when a user executes a new command:

image::UndoRedoActivityDiagram.png[width="650"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Implementation of `UndoableCommand`

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Add a new abstract method `executeUndoableCommand()`
** Pros: We will not lose any undone/redone functionality as it is now part of the default behaviour. Classes that deal with `Command` do not have to know that `executeUndoableCommand()` exist.
** Cons: Hard for new developers to understand the template pattern.
* **Alternative 2:** Just override `execute()`
** Pros: Does not involve the template pattern, easier for new developers to understand.
** Cons: Classes that inherit from `UndoableCommand` must remember to call `super.execute()`, or lose the ability to undo/redo.

===== Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire Infinity Book.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
** Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the candidate being deleted).
** Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.


===== Aspect: Type of commands that can be undone/redone

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Only include commands that modifies the Infinity Book (`add`, `clear`, `edit`).
** Pros: We only revert changes that are hard to change back (the view can easily be re-modified as no data are * lost).
** Cons: User might think that undo also applies when the list is modified (undoing filtering for example), * only to realize that it does not do that, after executing `undo`.
* **Alternative 2:** Include all commands.
** Pros: Might be more intuitive for the user.
** Cons: User have no way of skipping such commands if he or she just want to reset the state of the address * book and not the view.
**Additional Info:** See our discussion  https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/issues/390#issuecomment-298936672[here].


===== Aspect: Data structure to support the undo/redo commands

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use separate stack for undo and redo
** Pros: Easy to understand for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be * the new incoming developers of our project.
** Cons: Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update * both `HistoryManager` and `UndoRedoStack`.
* **Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo
** Pros: We do not need to maintain a separate stack, and just reuse what is already in the codebase.
** Cons: Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two * different things.
// end::undoredo[]

// tag::dataencryption[]
=== [Proposed] Data Encryption

Data is to be encrypted to protect the Infinity Book data from unauthorized access.

// end::dataencryption[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g App name, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

// tag::findall[]
=== Search by Name, Tags, Email, and Phone [Since v1.2]

This `find` command allows the user to search through the list of all candidates and output all whose  `Name`, `Tags`, `Email`, and `Phone` match with the given keywords.

==== Implementation Details

During execution of this command, Infinity Book will do the following:

. `FindCommandParser` class will extract keywords from user input, form a predicate, then pass it to `FindCommand` class.
. `FindCommand` will take in the predicate and update the list of Persons accordingly.

The condition for a candidate to be matched with given keywords is defined in `PersonContainsKeywordsPredicate`.

[source, java]
----
keywords.stream()
    .anyMatch(keyword -> StringUtil.containsWordIgnoreCase(person.getName().fullName, keyword)
    || StringUtil.containsWordIgnoreCase(person.getEmail().toString(), keyword)
    || StringUtil.containsWordIgnoreCase(person.getPhone().toString(), keyword)
    || person.getTags().stream()
    .anyMatch(tag -> StringUtil.containsWordIgnoreCase(tag.tagName, keyword)));
----

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** How user should specify the field to search +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Search for all `Name`, `Tags`, `Email`, and `Phone` +
**Pros:** User does not need to learn additional commands. +
**Cons:** There can be unintended results, but since the set of keywords to search for each field does not overlap with each other, so such unintended results are very rare. +
**Alternative 2:** Allow users to opt searching for one field in `Name`, `Tags`, `Email`, or `Phone`  +
**Pros:** User can narrow down the search result. +
**Cons:** User has to remember additional syntax.

---

**Aspect:**  The matching condition +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Return Persons whose `Name`, `Tags`, `Email`, or `Phone` have at least one keyword in the input keywords. +
**Pros:** User can do a wider search when he or she does not remember candidates' information clearly. +
**Cons:** User hardly does a detailed search. +
**Alternative 2:** Return Persons whose `Name`, `Tags`, `Email`, or `Phone` have all input keywords. +
**Pros:** User can narrow down the search results. +
**Cons:** In some cases, user cannot do a more general search.

=== Add/Remove Tags (Since v1.3)

The mechanics of `EditCommand` is that a new `Person` will be first created with the same information as the `Person` to edit.
Then edited fields of the new `Person` will be determined based on user inputs, then it will be used to update the persons list of Infinity Book.

[source, java]
----
personToEdit = lastShownList.get(index.getZeroBased());
editedPerson = editPersonDescriptor.createEditedPerson(personToEdit);

try {
    model.updatePerson(personToEdit, editedPerson);
}
----

From v1.0, user can overwrite any field of a candidate using `edit` command. Enhancing on top of this, the creation of the new `Person` is updated
so that user can add new tags by `edit -add-tag INDEX [t/TAG]...` command and remove existing tags by `edit -delete-tag [t/TAG]...` command.

The code snippet below shows the updated creation of new `Person`.

[source, java]
----
/**
 * Creates and returns a {@code Person} with the details of {@code personToEdit}
 * edited with {@code editPersonDescriptor}.
 */
public Person createEditedPerson(Person personToEdit) {
    boolean isTagsChanged = getTags().isPresent();
    boolean isNewTagsChanged = getNewTags().isPresent();
    boolean isDeletedTagsChanged = getDeletedTags().isPresent();

    boolean isMultipleTagsChanged = (isTagsChanged && isNewTagsChanged)
            || (isTagsChanged && isDeletedTagsChanged) || (isDeletedTagsChanged && isNewTagsChanged);
    assert !isMultipleTagsChanged;

    assert personToEdit != null;

    Name updatedName = getName().orElse(personToEdit.getName());
    Phone updatedPhone = getPhone().orElse(personToEdit.getPhone());
    Email updatedEmail = getEmail().orElse(personToEdit.getEmail());
    Remark updatedRemark = personToEdit.getRemark();
    Address updatedAddress = getAddress().orElse(personToEdit.getAddress());

    Set<Tag> updatedTags;
    Set<Tag> personTags = new HashSet<>(personToEdit.getTags());
    if (isTagsChanged) {
        updatedTags = getTags().orElse(null);
    } else if (isNewTagsChanged) {
        if (personTags.isEmpty()) {
            updatedTags = getNewTags().orElse(null);
        } else {
            updatedTags = personTags;
            updatedTags.addAll(getNewTags().orElse(null));
        }
    } else if (isDeletedTagsChanged) {
        updatedTags = personTags;
        if (personTags.isEmpty()) {
            updatedTags.removeAll(getDeletedTags().orElse(null));
        }
    } else {
        updatedTags = personTags;
    }


    return new Person(updatedName, updatedPhone, updatedEmail, updatedAddress, updatedRemark, updatedTags);
}
----

==== Design Considerations*
**Aspect:** Implementation of removing/adding tags +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Modify `EditPersonDescriptor` in `EditCommand` +
**Pros:** Prevent overlapping codes. +
**Cons:** Modify other details (e.g. Name, Phone, Address,...) apart from Tags. +
**Alternative 2:** Write a new EditPersonDescriptor for this command +
**Pros:** Maintain the current `edit` logic and behaviour. +
**Cons:** Duplicate the exact code, which may cause a lot of hassles in future development.

---

**Aspect:** Choosing command to add or remove tags +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Add `COMMAND_OPTION` (`-add-tag` and `-delete-tag`) to the current `edit` command. +
**Pros:** Adding or removing tags is indeed editing a Person's details, so it makes complete sense to perform this action using `edit` command and reduces the number of commands that user has to remember.  +
**Cons:** Have to modify the parser so that it can extract the option. +
**Alternative 2:** Using two new commands for adding and removing tags +
**Pros:** It is easier to parse the command.   +
**Cons:** User has to remember more commands.

=== Accept Option for Commands (Since v1.2)

To reduce the number of commands that user needs to learn, functions having similar behaviours can be grouped under one `COMMAND_WORD`, and each function in the group can be specified by `COMMAND_OPTION` by the user.

The command format is thus: `COMMAND_WORD [-COMMAND_OPTION] [PARAMETERS]...`

==== Implementation Details

Arguments including option are wrapped with the `ArgumentWithOption` class shown in the below code snippet.

[source, java]
----
/**
 *  ArgumentWithOption class encapsulates an argument in the format: [OPTION] ARGS, and handles the parsing, extracting
 *  option from the argument.
 */

public class ArgumentWithOption {

    private static final Pattern ARGUMENT_FORMAT =
            Pattern.compile("(?<commandOption>" + PREFIX_OPTION.getPrefix() + "\\S+)?(?<arguments>.*)");
    private String rawArgs;
    private final String option;
    private String args;

    public ArgumentWithOption(String rawArgs) throws ParseException {
        this.rawArgs = rawArgs.trim();

        final Matcher matcher = ARGUMENT_FORMAT.matcher(this.rawArgs);
        if (!matcher.matches()) {
            throw new ParseException(String.format(MESSAGE_INVALID_COMMAND_FORMAT, EditCommand.MESSAGE_USAGE));
        }
        this.args = matcher.group("arguments");

        String rawOption = matcher.group("commandOption");
        this.option = (rawOption != null) ?  rawOption.substring(PREFIX_OPTION.getPrefix().length()) : "";
    }

    public boolean isOption(String toCheck) {
        return toCheck.equals(option);
    }

    public String getArgs() {
        return args;
    }
}
----

The following snippet shows how `ArgumentWithOption` may be used

[source, java]
----
ArgumentWithOption argWithOption = new ArgumentWithOption(args);
// Get arguments
args = argWithOption.getArgs();
// Check for option
if (argWithOption.isOption(EditCommand.COMMAND_OPTION_ADD_TAG)) {
    parseTagsForEdit(argMultimap.getAllValues(PREFIX_TAG)).ifPresent(editPersonDescriptor::setNewTags);
}
----

// end::findall[]

=== Report (Since v1.4)

Each `Report` is identified with a `Tag population`:

Represented with the prefix `pop/` followed by the `tagName` of the `Tag population`. Example: `pop/SEIntern`.

In the report, you will find statistics of the group of all Persons tagged with `population`: +

. A bar chart showing all other Tags owned by this group and number of owners for each Tag.
. A pie chart illustrating the numerical proportion of each Tag.
. A history panel listing statistics of this group at earlier points of time.

User can view a report using `viewreport` command and save a report for future reference using `savereport` command.

==== Implementation Details

===== Model Component

For each report, all statistics details are encapsulated within the `Report` class. We use one `UniqueReportList` to keep all `Report` that user has saved.

Given the idea we use `UniqueReportList` to keep history, all `Report` instances in this list are immutable. There is no method to update instances in this list.
We keep one `Report` instance in Infinity Book so that we can show to the user.
This instance can be re-calculated via method `updateReport()` (implementation shown in the below snippet) in `Model` interface.

[source, java]
----
public void updateReport(Tag population) {

    // Get the list of `Person` tagged with `population`.

    FilteredList<Person> allPersonList = new FilteredList<>(this.addressBook.getPersonList());
    Predicate<Person> personContainsPopulationTagPredicate =
        new Predicate<Person>() {
            @Override
            public boolean test(Person person) {
                return person.getTags().stream()
                        .anyMatch(tag -> StringUtil.containsWordIgnoreCase(tag.tagName, population.tagName));
            }
        };
    allPersonList.setPredicate(personContainsPopulationTagPredicate);

    // Calculate statistics of other `Tag` owned by `Person` in this list

    Map<String, Pair<Integer, Integer>> counts = new HashMap<>();
    allPersonList.forEach((p) -> {
        Set<Tag> allTags = p.getTags();
        for (Tag t : allTags) {
            if (!t.tagName.equalsIgnoreCase(population.tagName)) {
                counts.merge(t.tagName, new Pair<>(1, 1), (a, b) ->
                        new Pair(a.getKey() + b.getKey(), a.getValue() + b.getValue()));
            }
        }
    });

    // Encapsulate statistics of each `Tag` in a `Proportion` instance

    List<Proportion> allProportions = new ArrayList<>();
    for (Map.Entry<String, Pair<Integer, Integer>> entry : counts.entrySet()) {
        allProportions.add(new Proportion(entry.getKey(), entry.getValue().getKey(), entry.getValue().getValue()));
    }

    report = new Report(population, allProportions, allPersonList.size());
}
----

===== Storage Component

We keep `UniqueReportList` persistently in XML files.

.`XmlAdaptedReport` in the structure of Storage Component of Infinity Book.
image::ReportStorageDiagram.jpg[width="700"]

One example of `Report` details stored in xml file:

[source, xml]
----
<reports>
    <population>SEIntern</population>
    <totalTags>11</totalTags>
    <totalPersons>11</totalPersons>
    <proportions>
        <proportionName>Screening</proportionName>
        <value>5</value>
        <totalPersonsInProportion>5</totalPersonsInProportion>
    </proportions>
    <proportions>
        <proportionName>Rejected</proportionName>
        <value>1</value>
        <totalPersonsInProportion>1</totalPersonsInProportion>
    </proportions>
    <proportions>
        <proportionName>Offered</proportionName>
        <value>2</value>
        <totalPersonsInProportion>2</totalPersonsInProportion>
    </proportions>
    <proportions>
        <proportionName>Interviewing</proportionName>
        <value>3</value>
        <totalPersonsInProportion>3</totalPersonsInProportion>
    </proportions>
    <date>04/06/2018 14:41:30</date>
</reports>
----

===== Logic Component

The below sequence diagram show interactions within `Logic` component when user executes `viewreport pop/CS`.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `viewreport pop/CS` Command
image::ViewReportDiagram.jpg[width="700"]

===== UI Component

'ReportPanel' extends `UiPart<Region>` and shares the same region with `BrowserPanel`. When `viewreport` or `savereport` is executed, `MainWindow` class will swap out the `BrowserPanel` for the `ReportPanel`.
We achieve this by posting `ToggleReportPanelEvent` (showing in the below sequence diagram).

.Posting event when we execute Report commands.
image::EventInteraction.jpg[width="700"]

The `EventsCenters` then handles this `Event` and then triggers the update of `Report` instance (as shown in the below seqence diagram).

.Update `Report` instance after the `ToggleReportPanelEvent` is posted
image::ComponentInteractions.jpg[width="700"]

==== Design Considerations
**Aspect:** Where calculation of statistics in the `Report` should be placed +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** in `ModelManager` +
**Pros:**
Since the calculation requires fetching the list of all Persons in Infinity Book, Defining it in the `ModelManager` to reduce dependency among components. +
**Cons:**
Have to modify multiple components such as `LogicManager`, `ModelManager`, `Event`. +
**Alternative 2:** in `Report` class itself +
**Pros:** Do not require a `Report` instance in Infinity Book, which can be redundant when user does not use. +
**Cons:** Have to write setter and getter to get the list of Persons from `Model`.

---

**Aspect:** Choosing the region to show `ReportPanel` +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** `ReportPanel` shares the same region with `BrowserPanel` +
**Pros:** Do not take additional area +
**Cons:** Have to implement `Event` handling to swap panel +
**Alternative 2:** Use a new panel +
**Pros:** User can view reports and the browser at the same time.   +
**Cons:** Add one more panel to the interface. +

=== Tag colors [since v1.0]

==== Current Implementation

Use different colors for different tags inside person cards. For example, `friends` tags can be all in red and `colleagues` tags can be all in blue
Pre-defined colors are included in `DarkTheme.css` and `LightTheme.css`
We use hash code of the tag names to generate a color. This is deliberately designed to ensure consistent colors each time the application runs.

==== Design considerations

**Aspect:** Implementation of color for tags +

**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Have tags to be colored using hashcode instead of randomization +
**Pros:** The color stay consistent each time the app is launched +
**Cons:** Limited number of colors (the limiting factor is the size of pre-define color array) +

**Alternative 2:** Have tag colors to be a random hexadecimal color value +
**Pros:** Number of different color is very big (i.e. there is less repetitive color used)   +
**Cons:** The color for each tag value might be different between app launchs +

//tag::viewcommand[]
=== Display relevant Github or resume page. (Since v1.3)

As a candidate may have linked online resume or github page. The recruiter may want
to consider these pages.

==== Design Considerations
**Aspect**: Aspects: Implementation of removing/adding a linked page.

**Alternative 1:**(current choice) Each person has a page, which is resume or github.
Add the view command to view a specific person, and view the linked page on the browser panel. +
**Pros:** The page can be linked to the person, and it is easier to view by person's email +
**Cons:** Need to modify current implementation of person model +
**Alternative 2:** Add a new command to view specific page, which is hard code URL.
**Pros:** No need to modify current person +
**Cons:** Hard to maintain the hard code URL

==== Implementation details
* `ViewCommandParser` class will extract emails ID from user input, form a predicate,
then pass it to `ViewCommand` class.
* `ViewCommand` will take in the predicate and update the list of Persons by email ID,
and change the browser panel accordingly.
source, java]
----
public class EmailFilter implements Predicate<Person> {
    private final String email;

    public EmailFilter (Email email) {
        this.email = email.toString();
    }

    @Override
    public boolean test(Person person) {
        return person.getEmail().toString().equals(this.email);
    }

    @Override
    public boolean equals(Object other) {
        return other == this // short circuit if same object
                || (other instanceof EmailFilter // instanceof handles nulls
                && this.email.equals(((EmailFilter) other).email)); // state check
    }

}
----

//end::viewcommand[]

// tag::autocorrect[]
=== Auto-correct and Auto-complete [since v1.4]

Infinity Book enhances the user's interaction with the application, with built in auto-correct and auto-complete. Command
words that are typed in are examined for spelling errors and completions upon `SPACE` and `TAB` press respectively.

To include completion and correction support for a new command, simply add it into commandDictionary in
CommandCorrection#createDictionary() as shown in code snippet.

[source:Java]
----
public static void createDictionary() {
        commandDictionary = new HashSet<>();

        // .. add other command words
        commandDictionary.add(PostJobCommand.COMMAND_WORD);
}
----

==== Auto-complete Implementation

The user input is recorded in CommandBox, and upon `TAB` keypress, the CommandBox#navigateToCompletedCommand() method looks for command
words containing the entered string as the first substring.

.This activity diagram demonstrates the high level behavior of the autocomplete feature.
image::AutocompleteActivityDiagram.png[width="700"]

When CommandCorrection#updateSuggestionsList() method is called, it searches through all command words for suitable matches.

When multiple matches are available, the `TAB` keypress is counted, and the command box cycles through all suggestions. When no suggestions are available, the existing
text is left unchanged.

Since the text in the command box is altered with each `TAB` press, a brief history is maintained containing the most recent suggestion
made by auto-complete and original user input. Here, the user has pressed the `TAB` key multiple times, but expects completions based on his input, not the recent suggestion that fills the command box.


The following code snipped demonstrates the use of the suggestion history to choose the text to complete.

[source:Java]
----
    public static String updateTextToComplete(String textToComplete) {
        if (textToComplete.compareTo(recentSuggestion.trim()) == 0) {
            return recentInput;
        } else {
            return textToComplete;
        }
    }
----

==== Auto-correct Implementation

Auto-correct searches command word input for potential one edit distance errors, including missed,swapped and stray characters.

Two details about the implementation are noteworthy:

. For seamless background operation, command words that are not recognized are automatically analysed for spelling errors on `SPACE` key press.
. In cases where commands with spell errors are copy-pasted into the command box, `SPACE` key press separates the command word from arguments, and corrects the command word without altering the rest of the command.

Upon being triggered, CommandBox#navigateToLikelyInput() method returns the likely correction using the mentioned heuristics.

When multiple suggestions are available, corrections obtained by removing stray character, and adding missing character are prioritized, in that order. This is in line with
belief that these are the most common kinds of errors.

The following code snippet demonstrates this ability clearly.

[source:Java]
----
   public static String extractCommandWord(String commandText) {
           String trimmedCommandText = commandText.trim();
           String[] wordsInCommandText = trimmedCommandText.split(" ");
           commandParameters = trimmedCommandText.replace(wordsInCommandText[0], "");
           return wordsInCommandText[0];
       }
----

// tag::jobposting[]
=== Job Postings [Since v1.3]

Recruiters may have several job openings available with varying required skills, location and tags. These are represented in the Infinity
Book as Job Postings. Job postings may be added or removed at any time. Existing job postings can be listed, searched, edited and deleted.
Any existing job postings may be matched with the list of candidates to filter potential matches.

==== Implementation Specifics

===== Model Component

Job postings are maintained in the Model in a UniqueJobList, enforcing uniqueness among the stored individual job postings.

.UML diagram showing representation of UniqueJobList in Infinity Book.
image::UniqueJobListUML.png[width="300"]

Individual job postings are represented by the Job object with attributes `Job Title`, `Location`, `Skills` and `Tags`. The class relationship is shown
in Figure _{num}_ .

.UML diagram showing representation of Job in Infinity Book.
image::JobUMLDiagram.png[width="400"]

In addition, the Person and Job class have been modified to maintain Skills as an additional field to offer better functionality
during candidate-job matching. The `add` and `edit` commands reflect these changes as well.

Together, this modifies the Model to the state shown in the following diagram.

.A complete picture of the model as mantained by Infinity Book.
image::ModelWithJobUML.png[width="700"]

===== Storage Component

Job postings are stored in `XmlAdaptedJob` objects, which maintain a class relationship as shown in this diagram.

.Job objects are saved using XmlAdaptedJob objects as shown above.
image::JobStorageDiagram.png[width="700"]

An example job stored in this format is reproduced below:

[source:xml]
----
<jobs>
        <jobTitle>Backend Engineer</jobTitle>
        <location>Geylang</location>
        <skills>Java,SQL</skills>
        <tagged>SEIntern</tagged>
        <tagged>ATAP</tagged>
</jobs>
----

===== UI Component

The main window contains a JobListPanel, which contains individual jobs represented using JobListCards.
JobListCards represent the fields in each Job using Labels and flowPanes.

===== Job Operations and Logic

Operations performed on jobs follow the sequence of operations described in the diagram below.

. Command input is received by the UI component.
. The command execution is handled by the Logic component.
. The changes to data are effected by the Model component.
. The new Infinity Book data is saved by the Storage component.

This sequence of events is summarized in the following sequence diagram.

.A high level sequence diagram showing events triggered by the `postjob` command.
image::SequenceDiagramJobPosting.png[width="700"]

The following job posting commands are implemented extending `UndoableCommand` and `Command`:

[width="50%",cols="<50%,<50%",options="header",]
|=====================
|extends `UndoableCommand` | extends `Command`
|`PostJobCommand` +
 `EditJobCommand` +
 `DeleteJobCommand` +
 `MatchJobCommand` | `ListJobCommand` +
  `FindJobCommand`
|=====================

The following diagram details the class relationship for Commands.

.UML Diagram depicting the class relationship between command classes.
image::CommandsStructure.png[width="300"]

---

*Adding Job Postings*

Adding job postings to Infinity Book is performed by the PostJobCommand. The sequence of events triggered while adding a job posting are shown in the diagram below:

.Adding a job posting is executed as shown above.
image::PostJobCommandSequenceDiagram.png[width="700"]

The PostJobCommand#executeUndoableCommand triggers addition of the Job to `UniqueJobList` in AddressBook#add
The following code snippet demonstrates the prevention of duplicates in the UniqueJobList
[source:Java]
----
    public void add(Job toAdd) throws DuplicateJobException {
        requireNonNull(toAdd);
        if (contains(toAdd)) {
            throw new DuplicateJobException();
        }
        internalList.add(toAdd);
    }
----

---

*Editing Job Postings*

Editing job postings in the Infinity Book is performed by the EditJobCommand. The sequence of events triggered while editing a job posting are shown in the diagram below:

.Editing a job posting is executed as shown above.
image::EditJobCommandSequenceDiagram.png[width="700"]

The EditJobCommand#executeUndoableCommand triggers editing of a existing Job in `UniqueJobList` in AddressBook#add
The `EditJobCommand` ensures that the index specified refers to a valid index in the most recent listing of jobs.
Editing jobs to cause duplicates in the UniqueJobList is prevented by throwing a DuplicateJobException.

The following code snippet demonstrates the prevention of duplicates and index checking in the UniqueJobList after editing

[source:Java]
----
    public void setJob(Job target, Job editedJob) throws DuplicateJobException, JobNotFoundException {
        requireNonNull(editedJob);

        int index = internalList.indexOf(target);
        if (index == -1) {
            throw new JobNotFoundException();
        }

        if (!target.equals(editedJob) && internalList.contains(editedJob)) {
            throw new DuplicateJobException();
        }

        internalList.set(index, editedJob);
    }
----

To completely specify the changes to the Job object specified by EditJobCommand, an EditJobCommandDescriptor is parsed from the command, and used to update changes in the Model. Completing
these operations ensures the new Job object is updated in the Infinity Book.

---

*Delete Job Postings*

Deleting job postings in the Infinity Book is performed by the DeleteJobCommand. The sequence of events triggered while deleting a job posting are shown in the diagram below:

.Deleting a job posting is executed as shown above.
image::DeleteJobCommandSequenceDiagram.png[width="700"]

The DeleteJobCommand selects a Job object by matching the index with the last shown job list, and checks the index as shown in the following code snippet.
[source:Java]
----
 protected void preprocessUndoableCommand() throws CommandException {
        List<Job> lastShownList = model.getFilteredJobList();

        if (targetIndex.getZeroBased() >= lastShownList.size()) {
            throw new CommandException(Messages.MESSAGE_INVALID_JOB_DISPLAYED_INDEX);
        }

        jobToDelete = lastShownList.get(targetIndex.getZeroBased());
----
The changes to the UniqueJobList are enacted by AddressBook#removeJob, which completes the removal of the object and triggers Storage to update the data.

---

*Matching Job Postings*

Matching job postings to candidates in the Infinity Book is performed by the MatchJobCommand.

The sequence of events triggered while matching a job posting are shown in the diagram below:

.`matchjob` uses predicate based filtering similar to `findjob` and `listjobs`
image::matchJobSequenceDiagram.png[width="700"]

The MatchJobCommand selects a Job object by matching the index with the last shown job list. A PersonMatchesJobPredicate is used to find matches, by looking for matches between tags, location and skills fields of the Job and Person.

Search parameters can be excluded from search when they are set to 'ALL'. Under these circumstances only the other parameters will influence the search.

The following code snippet shows how Location can be excluded from the search. Other two parameters are handles similarly.

[source:Java]
----
public boolean test(Person person) {

        // .. code to set up and assign locationMatch, skillsMatch and tagsMatch

        locationMatch = isLocationMatchSatisfied(locationMatch);
        //.. similarly for skillsMatch and tagsMatch

        return locationMatch && skillsMatch && tagsMatch;
 }

 private boolean isLocationMatchSatisfied(boolean locationMatch) {
         if (notLocationBound) {
             locationMatch = true;
         }
         return locationMatch;
 }
----

The PersonListPanel is populated with a list of candidates who match the job according to the set parameters.

---

*Listing Job Postings*

Listing all job postings in the Infinity Book is performed by the FindJobCommand. The sequence of events triggered while listing all job postings are shown in the diagram below:

.Sequence diagram above shows the sequence of events triggered on execution of `listjobs`
image::listjobcommandSequenceDiagram.png[width="700"]

The ListJobCommand selects displays all Job objects from UniqueJobList in the JobListPanel.

---

*Finding Job Postings*

Finding job postings by keywords in the Infinity Book is performed by the FindJobCommand. The sequence of events triggered while finding a job posting are extremely similar to listing all job postings as in Figure above, differing only in the specifics of the predicate used.

The FindJobCommand selects Job objects to display by matching the keyword with the Job Title, Location or Tags, and lists all matches in the JobListPanel.

==== Design Considerations
**Aspect:** Implementation of additional Skill parameter for Person and Job +

**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Maintain skills as list of strings. +
**Pros:** Allows recruiter freedom in creating a skills list as they need. +
**Cons:** Searching requires complex string operations. Duplicates of the same skill will be found under different persons. +

**Alternative 2:** Maintain a UniqueSkillsList similar to tags. +
**Pros:** Different candidates with similar skills will utilize the same object. +
**Cons:** The list of skills must be synchronized with both person list and job list, removing any skills that are not used by both.

---

**Aspect:** Implementation of Job-Person Matching +

**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Match as many keywords in an OR search as possible +
**Pros:** Maintains existing search predicates with minor modifications. +
**Cons:** May not provide effective filtering. +

**Alternative 2:** Indicate required and optional matches in job posting. +
**Pros:** Search can be customized to be as accurate as required. +
**Cons:** Spelling differences may still cause diminished effectiveness.

// end::jobposting[]

// tag::theme[]

=== Theming Mechanism [since v1.3]

The theme mechanism is facilitated by a singleton class `UiStyle` which will be called inside the `MainWindow` constructor where it passes its `scene` into the `UiStyle` class.
The `scene` is necessary for changing the CSS at runtime.

The class `UiStyle` requires the scene to be set at `MainWindow` class so that it can be used to edit themes.


----
public class UiStyle {
    ...
    private static Scene scene = null;

    public static void setScene(Scene s) {
        scene = s;
        setDefaultTheme();
    }

    private static void setDefaultTheme() {
        scene.getStylesheets().add(DARK_THEME_STYLE);
    }

    public static void setToLightTheme() {
        scene.getStylesheets().setAll(LIGHT_THEME_STYLE);
    }

    public static void setToDarkTheme() {
        scene.getStylesheets().setAll(DARK_THEME_STYLE);
    }
    ...
}
----

Example of calling the application to change to light theme:

----
UiStyle.getInstance().setToLightTheme();
----

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Ways to change the application theme +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a dedicated singleton class `UiStyle` to change the theme +
**Pros:** Provide a dedicated class that manages all the changing of themes. `UiStyle` can contain many CSS theme file paths and thus the theme mechanism is more scalable . It is easier for `ThemeCommand` class to call `UiStyle` instance and use its methods directly. +
**Cons:** Increases coupling +
**Alternative 2:** Change the themes in `MainWindow` class directly +
**Pros:** Decreases coupling +
**Cons:** Violates the single responsibility principle since `MainWindow` class also controls the changing of theme. It is harder for `ThemeCommand` class to access the methods from `MainWindow` to change theme +

// end::theme[]

//tag::interviewmanagement[]
=== Interview Management [Since v1.5rc]
Interviewing is one of the important steps in recruiting process.
HR may need a tool to manage interview efficiently. The Infinity Book will
need interview model with basic features including adding interview, listing
interview, and deleting interview.

* Model Component:

image::InterviewModel.png[width="700"]
Figure 5.13.1: add Interview Model to Model Component

* Storage Component:

image::InterviewStorage.png[width="700]
Figure 5.13.2 add XmlAdaptedInterview to Storage Component

==== Adding an interview
The recruiter may want to conduct an interview with candidates, and maintain
an interview lists.

Aspects: Implementation of removing/add interview with candidates.

**Alternative 1:** (current choice): Add a new model interview including many
sub fields such as Date, Location, List of Questions. +
**Pros:** It is easier to implement other commands such as find Interview, delete
Interview, add questions. +
**Cons:** It takes time to create new model.

**Alternative 2:** Add a new field interview to each candidates and maintain
according to each candidates. +
**Pros:** It is easier to implement. +
**Cons:** It is difficult to search specific interview effectively.

** Current implementation details
* `AddInterviewCommandParser` class will extract interview title, interviewee name, date,
and interview location from user input, form a new interview,
then pass it to `AddInterviewCommand` class.
* `AddInterviewCommand` will take in the interview and call add new Interview to
storage in model.

[source,java]
----
public synchronized void addInterview(Interview interview) throws DuplicateInterviewException {
        addressBook.addInterview(interview);
        updateFilteredInterviewList(PREDICATE_SHOW_ALL_INTERVIEWS);
        indicateAddressBookChanged();
}
----

==== List interview
The recruiter may want to take a look at all of the interviews.

Aspects: Implementation of listing all the interviews.

**Alternative 1:** (current choice) create a new command to listing all the interview. +
**Pros:** It is easier to use and modify. +
**Cons:** New command is needed.

**Alternative 2:** each candidate has been linked to an interview, listing all the
interview when listing all candidates. +
**Pros:** No need to create new command, just need to edit current list comamnd +
**Cons:** It increases coupling and it is harder to implement.

** Current implementation details
* `AddressBookParser` class will parse the command `listInterview` from CLI
and call ListInterviewCommand.
* `ListInterviewCommand` will call updateFilteredList in model and list all the interviews in storage.

[source,java]
----

public void updateFilteredInterviewList(Predicate<Interview> predicate) {
        requireNonNull(predicate);
        filteredInterviews.setPredicate(predicate);
}
----

==== Deleting Interview
After conducted interview, the HR may want to delete the interview from the Infinity Book.

Aspects: Implementation of deleting an interview:

**Alternative 1:** (current choice) create deleting command for deleting interview by index +
**Pros:** It can be easily to use follow the index of listing interview command +
**Cons:** It requires users to use two commands +

**Alternative 2:** create deleting command for deleting interview by name. +
**Pros:** It requires addtional tools to match interview +
**Cons:** It is easier for user to use.

** Current implementation details
* `DeletingInterviewParser` class will extract the index of the interview needed
to be deleted and pass in to `DeleteInterviewCommand`.
* `DeleteInterviewCommand` will take in the index and update the interview list
accordingly.

[source,java]
----

public synchronized void deleteInterview(Interview target) throws InterviewNotFoundException {
        addressBook.removeInterview(target);
        indicateAddressBookChanged();
}

== Documentation
This project maintains documentation in the docs folder, also accessible through the readme. This documentation is written and maintained using *asciidoc*.

[NOTE]
We chose asciidoc over Markdown because asciidoc, although a bit more complex than Markdown, provides more flexibility in formatting.

=== Editing Documentation

See <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to render `.adoc` files locally to preview the end result of your edits.
Alternatively, you can download the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ, which allows you to preview the changes you have made to your `.adoc` files in real-time.

=== Publishing Documentation

See <<UsingTravis#deploying-github-pages, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to deploy GitHub Pages using Travis.

=== Converting Documentation to PDF format

We use https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/[Google Chrome] for converting documentation to PDF format, as Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages.

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format.

.  Follow the instructions in <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to convert the AsciiDoc files in the `docs/` directory to HTML format.
.  Go to your generated HTML files in the `build/docs` folder, right click on them and select `Open with` -> `Google Chrome`.
.  Within Chrome, click on the `Print` option in Chrome's menu.
.  Set the destination to `Save as PDF`, then click `Save` to save a copy of the file in PDF format. For best results, use the settings indicated in the screenshot below.

[[Testing]]
== Testing
The Infinity Book project maintains GUI and non-GUI tests. Instructions on writing and running tests, and details about the nature of these tests are provided in this section.

=== Running Tests

There are three ways to run tests.

[TIP]
The most reliable way to run tests is the 3rd one. The first two methods might fail some GUI tests due to platform/resolution-specific idiosyncrasies.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`

*Method 2: Using Gradle*

* Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean allTests`)

[NOTE]
See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more info on how to run tests using Gradle.

*Method 3: Using Gradle (headless)*

Thanks to the https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX] library we use, our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode. In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.

To run tests in headless mode, open a console and run the command `gradlew clean headless allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean headless allTests`)

=== Types of tests

We have two types of tests:

.  *GUI Tests* - These are tests involving the GUI. They include,
.. _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. These are in the `systemtests` package.
.. _Unit tests_ that test the individual components. These are in `seedu.address.ui` package.
.  *Non-GUI Tests* - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
..  _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. `seedu.address.commons.StringUtilTest`
..  _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working). +
e.g. `seedu.address.storage.StorageManagerTest`
..  Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as how the are connected together. +
e.g. `seedu.address.logic.LogicManagerTest`


=== Troubleshooting Testing
**Problem: `HelpWindowTest` fails with a `NullPointerException`.**

* Reason: One of its dependencies, `UserGuide.html` in `src/main/resources/docs` is missing.
* Solution: Execute Gradle task `processResources`.

== Dev Ops

=== Build Automation

See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

=== Continuous Integration

We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] and https://www.appveyor.com/[AppVeyor] to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> for more details.

=== Coverage Reporting

We use https://coveralls.io/[Coveralls] to track the code coverage of our projects. See <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>> for more details.

=== Documentation Previews
When a pull request has changes to asciidoc files, you can use https://www.netlify.com/[Netlify] to see a preview of how the HTML version of those asciidoc files will look like when the pull request is merged. See <<UsingNetlify#, UsingNetlify.adoc>> for more details.

=== Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp.java`].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file you created.

=== Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, Infinity Book depends on the http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome[Jackson library] for XML parsing. Managing these _dependencies_ can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than these alternatives. +
a. Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size) +
b. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)

[[GetStartedProgramming]]
[appendix]
== Suggested Programming Tasks to Get Started

Suggested path for new programmers:

1. First, add small local-impact (i.e. the impact of the change does not go beyond the component) enhancements to one component at a time. Some suggestions are given in <<GetStartedProgramming-EachComponent>>.

2. Next, add a feature that touches multiple components to learn how to implement an end-to-end feature across all components. <<GetStartedProgramming-RemarkCommand>> explains how to go about adding such a feature.

[[GetStartedProgramming-EachComponent]]
=== Improving each component

Each individual exercise in this section is component-based (i.e. you would not need to modify the other components to get it to work).

[discrete]
==== `Logic` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `logic`. During dog-fooding, your team realize that it is troublesome for the user to type the whole command in order to execute a command. Your team devise some strategies to help cut down the amount of typing necessary, and one of the suggestions was to implement aliases for the command words. Your job is to implement such aliases.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Logic>> before attempting to modify the `Logic` component.

. Add a shorthand equivalent alias for each of the individual commands. For example, besides typing `clear`, the user can also type `c` to remove all persons in the list.
+
****
* Hints
** Just like we store each individual command word constant `COMMAND_WORD` inside `*Command.java` (e.g.  link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/FindCommand.java[`FindCommand#COMMAND_WORD`], link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/DeleteCommand.java[`DeleteCommand#COMMAND_WORD`]), you need a new constant for aliases as well (e.g. `FindCommand#COMMAND_ALIAS`).
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser`] is responsible for analyzing command words.
* Solution
** Modify the switch statement in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser#parseCommand(String)`] such that both the proper command word and alias can be used to execute the same intended command.
** Add new tests for each of the aliases that you have added.
** Update the user guide to document the new aliases.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/785[PR] for the full solution.
****

[discrete]
==== `Model` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `model`. One day, the `logic`-in-charge approaches you for help. He wants to implement a command such that the user is able to remove a particular tag from everyone in the Infinity Book, but the model API does not support such a functionality at the moment. Your job is to implement an API method, so that your teammate can use your API to implement his command.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Model>> before attempting to modify the `Model` component.

. Add a `removeTag(Tag)` method. The specified tag will be removed from everyone in the Infinity Book.
+
****
* Hints
** The link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model`] and the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`] API need to be updated.
** Think about how you can use SLAP to design the method. Where should we place the main logic of deleting tags?
**  Find out which of the existing API methods in  link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`] classes can be used to implement the tag removal logic. link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`] allows you to update a person, and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`] allows you to update the tags.
* Solution
** Implement a `removeTag(Tag)` method in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`]. Loop through each person, and remove the `tag` from each person.
** Add a new API method `deleteTag(Tag)` in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/ModelManager.java[`ModelManager`]. Your link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/ModelManager.java[`ModelManager`] should call `AddressBook#removeTag(Tag)`.
** Add new tests for each of the new public methods that you have added.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/790[PR] for the full solution.
*** The current codebase has a flaw in tags management. Tags no longer in use by anyone may still exist on the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`]. This may cause some tests to fail. See issue  https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/issues/753[`#753`] for more information about this flaw.
*** The solution PR has a temporary fix for the flaw mentioned above in its first commit.
****

[discrete]
==== `Ui` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `ui`. During a beta testing session, your team is observing how the users use your Infinity Book application. You realize that one of the users occasionally tries to delete non-existent tags from a contact, because the tags all look the same visually, and the user got confused. Another user made a typing mistake in his command, but did not realize he had done so because the error message wasn't prominent enough. A third user keeps scrolling down the list, because he keeps forgetting the index of the last candidate in the list. Your job is to implement improvements to the UI to solve all these problems.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Ui>> before attempting to modify the `UI` component.

. Use different colors for different tags inside candidate cards. For example, `friends` tags can be all in brown, and `colleagues` tags can be all in yellow.
+
**Before**

image::getting-started-ui-tag-before.png[width="300"]
+
**After**
+
image::getting-started-ui-tag-after.png[width="300"]
+
****
* Hints
** The tag labels are created inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[the `PersonCard` constructor] (`new Label(tag.tagName)`). https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javafx/api/javafx/scene/control/Label.html[JavaFX's `Label` class] allows you to modify the style of each Label, such as changing its color.
** Use the .css attribute `-fx-background-color` to add a color.
** You may wish to modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/DarkTheme.css[`DarkTheme.css`] to include some pre-defined colors using css, especially if you have experience with web-based css.
* Solution
** You can modify the existing test methods for `PersonCard` 's to include testing the tag's color as well.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/798[PR] for the full solution.
*** The PR uses the hash code of the tag names to generate a color. This is deliberately designed to ensure consistent colors each time the application runs. You may wish to expand on this design to include additional features, such as allowing users to set their own tag colors, and directly saving the colors to storage, so that tags retain their colors even if the hash code algorithm changes.
****

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] such that link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay`] can show a different style on error (currently it shows the same regardless of errors).

**After**
+
image::getting-started-ui-result-after.png[width="200"]

****
* Hints
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] is raised by link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/CommandBox.java[`CommandBox`] which also knows whether the result is a success or failure, and is caught by link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay`] which is where we want to change the style to.
** Refer to link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/CommandBox.java[`CommandBox`] for an example on how to display an error.
* Solution
** Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] 's constructor so that users of the event can indicate whether an error has occurred.
** Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay#handleNewResultAvailableEvent(NewResultAvailableEvent)`] to react to this event appropriately.
** You can write two different kinds of tests to ensure that the functionality works:
*** The unit tests for `ResultDisplay` can be modified to include verification of the color.
*** The system tests link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/systemtests/AddressBookSystemTest.java[`AddressBookSystemTest#assertCommandBoxShowsDefaultStyle() and AddressBookSystemTest#assertCommandBoxShowsErrorStyle()`] to include verification for `ResultDisplay` as well.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/799[PR] for the full solution.
*** Do read the commits one at a time if you feel overwhelmed.

**After**
+
image::getting-started-ui-status-after.png[width="500"]

****
* Hints
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/StatusBarFooter.fxml[`StatusBarFooter.fxml`] will need a new `StatusBar`. Be sure to set the `GridPane.columnIndex` properly for each `StatusBar` to avoid misalignment!
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter`] needs to initialize the status bar on application start, and to update it accordingly whenever the Infinity Book is updated.
* Solution
** Modify the constructor of link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter`] to take in the number of persons when the application just started.
** Use link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter#handleAddressBookChangedEvent(AddressBookChangedEvent)`] to update the number of persons whenever there are new changes to the addressbook.
** For tests, modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/guitests/guihandles/StatusBarFooterHandle.java[`StatusBarFooterHandle`] by adding a state-saving functionality for the total number of people status, just like what we did for save location and sync status.
** For system tests, modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/systemtests/AddressBookSystemTest.java[`AddressBookSystemTest`] to also verify the new total number of persons status bar.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/803[PR] for the full solution.

==== `Storage` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `storage`. For your next project milestone, your team plans to implement a new feature of saving the Infinity Book to the cloud. However, the current implementation of the application constantly saves the Infinity Book after the execution of each command, which is not ideal if the user is working on limited internet connection. Your team decided that the application should instead save the changes to a temporary local backup file first, and only upload to the cloud after the user closes the application. Your job is to implement a backup API for the Infinity Book storage.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Storage>> before attempting to modify the `Storage` component.

. Add a new method `backupAddressBook(ReadOnlyAddressBook)`, so that the Infinity Book can be saved in a fixed temporary location.
+
****
* Hint
** Add the API method in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/AddressBookStorage.java[`AddressBookStorage`] interface.
** Implement the logic in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/StorageManager.java[`StorageManager`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/XmlAddressBookStorage.java[`XmlAddressBookStorage`] class.
* Solution
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/594[PR] for the full solution.

[[GetStartedProgramming-RemarkCommand]]
=== Creating a new command: `remark`

By creating this command, you will get a chance to learn how to implement a feature end-to-end, touching all major components of the app.

*Scenario:* You are a software maintainer for `addressbook`, as the former developer team has moved on to new projects. The current users of your application have a list of new feature requests that they hope the software will eventually have. The most popular request is to allow adding additional comments/notes about a particular contact, by providing a flexible `remark` field for each contact, rather than relying on tags alone. After designing the specification for the `remark` command, you are convinced that this feature is worth implementing. Your job is to implement the `remark` command.

==== Description
Edits the remark for a candidate specified in the `INDEX`. +
Format: `remark INDEX r/[REMARK]`

Examples:

* `remark 1 r/Likes to drink coffee.` +
Edits the remark for the first candidate to `Likes to drink coffee.`
* `remark 1 r/` +
Removes the remark for the first person.

==== Step-by-step Instructions

===== [Step 1] Logic: Teach the app to accept 'remark' which does nothing
Let's start by teaching the application how to parse a `remark` command. We will add the logic of `remark` later.

**Main:**

. Add a `RemarkCommand` that extends link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/UndoableCommand.java[`UndoableCommand`]. Upon execution, it should just throw an `Exception`.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser`] to accept a `RemarkCommand`.

**Tests:**

. Add `RemarkCommandTest` that tests that `executeUndoableCommand()` throws an Exception.
. Add new test method to link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParserTest.java[`AddressBookParserTest`], which tests that typing "remark" returns an instance of `RemarkCommand`.

===== [Step 2] Logic: Teach the app to accept 'remark' arguments
Let's teach the application to parse arguments that our `remark` command will accept. E.g. `1 r/Likes to drink coffee.`

**Main:**

. Modify `RemarkCommand` to take in an `Index` and `String` and print those two parameters as the error message.
. Add `RemarkCommandParser` that knows how to parse two arguments, one index and one with prefix 'r/'.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser`] to use the newly implemented `RemarkCommandParser`.

**Tests:**

. Modify `RemarkCommandTest` to test the `RemarkCommand#equals()` method.
. Add `RemarkCommandParserTest` that tests different boundary values
for `RemarkCommandParser`.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParserTest.java[`AddressBookParserTest`] to test that the correct command is generated according to the user input.

===== [Step 3] Ui: Add a placeholder for remark in `PersonCard`
Let's add a placeholder on all our link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] s to display a remark for each candidate later.

**Main:**

. Add a `Label` with any random text inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/PersonListCard.fxml[`PersonListCard.fxml`].
. Add FXML annotation in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] to tie the variable to the actual label.

**Tests:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/guitests/guihandles/PersonCardHandle.java[`PersonCardHandle`] so that future tests can read the contents of the remark label.

===== [Step 4] Model: Add `Remark` class
We have to properly encapsulate the remark in our link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`] class. Instead of just using a `String`, let's follow the conventional class structure that the codebase already uses by adding a `Remark` class.

**Main:**

. Add `Remark` to model component (you can copy from link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Address.java[`Address`], remove the regex and change the names accordingly).
. Modify `RemarkCommand` to now take in a `Remark` instead of a `String`.

**Tests:**

. Add test for `Remark`, to test the `Remark#equals()` method.

===== [Step 5] Model: Modify `Person` to support a `Remark` field
Now we have the `Remark` class, we need to actually use it inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`].

**Main:**

. Add `getRemark()` in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`].
. You may assume that the user will not be able to use the `add` and `edit` commands to modify the remarks field (i.e. the candidate will be created without a remark).
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/util/SampleDataUtil.java/[`SampleDataUtil`] to add remarks for the sample data (delete your `addressBook.xml` so that the application will load the sample data when you launch it.)

===== [Step 6] Storage: Add `Remark` field to `XmlAdaptedPerson` class
We now have `Remark` s for `Person` s, but they will be gone when we exit the application. Let's modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/XmlAdaptedPerson.java[`XmlAdaptedPerson`] to include a `Remark` field so that it will be saved.

**Main:**

. Add a new Xml field for `Remark`.

**Tests:**

. Fix `invalidAndValidPersonAddressBook.xml`, `typicalPersonsAddressBook.xml`, `validAddressBook.xml` etc., such that the XML tests will not fail due to a missing `<remark>` element.

===== [Step 6b] Test: Add withRemark() for `PersonBuilder`
Since `Person` can now have a `Remark`, we should add a helper method to link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/testutil/PersonBuilder.java[`PersonBuilder`], so that users are able to create remarks when building a link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`].

**Tests:**

. Add a new method `withRemark()` for link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/testutil/PersonBuilder.java[`PersonBuilder`]. This method will create a new `Remark` for the candidate that it is currently building.
. Try and use the method on any sample `Person` in link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/testutil/TypicalPersons.java[`TypicalPersons`].

===== [Step 7] Ui: Connect `Remark` field to `PersonCard`
Our remark label in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] is still a placeholder. Let's bring it to life by binding it with the actual `remark` field.

**Main:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`]'s constructor to bind the `Remark` field to the `Person` 's remark.

**Tests:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/ui/testutil/GuiTestAssert.java[`GuiTestAssert#assertCardDisplaysPerson(...)`] so that it will compare the now-functioning remark label.

===== [Step 8] Logic: Implement `RemarkCommand#execute()` logic
We now have everything set up... but we still can't modify the remarks. Let's finish it up by adding in actual logic for our `remark` command.

**Main:**

. Replace the logic in `RemarkCommand#execute()` (that currently just throws an `Exception`), with the actual logic to modify the remarks of a person.

**Tests:**

. Update `RemarkCommandTest` to test that the `execute()` logic works.

==== Full Solution

[appendix]
== Product Scope

*Target user profile*:
Tech recruiters who have the need for finding and acquiring skilled Computing students for tech companies.

* manage a significant number of student contacts
* store student's basic information, contacts, expected graduation year, familiar frameworks, languages.
* find students whose skill set is suitable for available positions
* Keep track of student’s past interactions with the company: internship, coding challenges, interview,...

=== Feature contributions
==== Sashankh Chengavalli Kumar (@ChengSashankh)
===== Major Enhancement: Job postings
This allows the recruiter to add and manage job postings and receive automated suggestions about most suitable candidates based on various parameters.

For example, when the need arises to hire a new fresh graduate for a backend software development role with proficiency in SQL and Javascript, with location restrictions as well, the recruiter creates a job posting. As candidates are added and removed, the application displays an updated list of matching candidates, until removed from Infinity Book.

Implementations needed:

. Creating command such as postjob, editjob, deletejob, findjob and listjob to manage jobposting.
. Creating a matchjob command that displays the list of matched candidates in the Infinity Book.
. Display pane for showing the list of jobs currently active.
. Adding skills field to Person and Job to enhance matching.

===== Minor Enhancement: Auto-correct and auto-complete
This allows users to interact with Infinity Book with enhanced speed and accuracy. This implementation provides
users the ability to auto-correct trivial spelling errors and complete partial command words.

For example, when `li` is typed, the command enables completion to either `list` , `listinterview` or `listjob`. Similarly
`lsit` is corrected to `list` by the command.

Implementations needed:

. Complete list of command words used by Infinity Book has to be updated and maintained when features are added.
. Command box has to be modified to consume some keypresses such as `TAB` and `SPACE` for completion and correction.
. To support multiple suggestions for auto-complete, a brief history of the last suggestion and input has to be maintained. This is
further explained in <<Auto-complete Implementation, Section 5.11.1>>


==== Huynh Thanh Duc Anh (@anh2111)
===== Major Enhancement: Data visualization
This allows users to make data-driven decisions with the visualization of recruiting data.

image::graph.png[width="500"]

In the above example, `Screening`, `Interviewing`, `Accepted`, `SoftwareEngineerIntern` are tags that can be managed
conveniently by the user. Given this chart, the recruiter can help a better high-level insights of candidates, which
helps them significantly in making decisions.

Implementations needed:

. Making Command accepts OPTION. Example: `tag add`, `tag remove`.
. Allowing add/remove one tag.
. Drawing chart.

===== Minor Enhancement: Enhance Find command
* Allow users to Find Person by name, phone, email, and tags.
* Given the huge number of contacts that a recruiter may have, it is not possible for them to remember candidates' name.
 Hence, users should be able to search by other fields so that it's easier for them to locate a person.

==== Nguyen Thi Viet Ha (@deeheenguyen)
===== Major Enhancement: Adding Interview
This allows the recruiters maintain a list of interview. Each Interview is linked to a
person. The recruiters can search about the interview based on the candidates.

Implementation needed:

. Make a interview model
. Add a interview command
. Make the interview searchable.

===== Minor Enhancement: View Command
. Given a list of candidates, the recruiters can view a specific person by emailID.
. Display all the information in the person card.
. If there is a linked page to the person, it will be displayed on the brower panel.

==== Nguyen Dinh Dung (@tiny767)
===== Major Enhancement: Make several enhancements to the UI so that it is much more user-friendly.
This allows tech recruiters who need to manage big Infinity Books to save time by using the app more efficiently
and feel more comfortable.

Implementations needed:

* Making the color for tags the same for tags with same name and the choice of color stays the same.
* For the user's command input, coloring keywords such as `name`, `p/`.
* Provide usage syntax or syntax error in real time (e.g. display syntax for `add` when the users finish typing 'add'

===== Minor Enhancement: `remark` command
* Allow users to add remarks for people in their Infinity Books.
* This allows tech recruiters to have a more flexible field to use for their candidates
